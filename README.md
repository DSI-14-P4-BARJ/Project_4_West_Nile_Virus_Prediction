**by: Anastasiya Ivanova, Bryan Ho, Roshan Khemlani, Junyuan Lin | SG-DSI-14**

## Introduction

The objective is to build a classification model to predict the presence of West Nile Virus.

## Problem Statement

To create a model to predict the presence of West Nile Virus(WNV) based on geospatial and weather information and identify the most important influencing features in Chicago, Illinois.

## Target Audience and Evaluation Metrics

This model is targeted at Chicago City health officials, as it will help them identify hotspots where carriers of the West Nile Virus may see a spike in populations, or even take preventive or preemptive actions to curb the growth of WNV carriers.



For this problem, we would prefer to have higher sensitivity/recall due to the negative impact of False Negatives. The main metric is the AUC ROC score.

 ## Conclusions and Recommendations
